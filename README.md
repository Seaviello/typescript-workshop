### What can you find here?
I use this repository as an aggregation of examples that show specific concepts from TypeScript. It is set up in node environment,
so for browser examples you need to find something different - highly recommend codesandbox with typscript template.

### How to conduct presentation using this repository
I am a forgetful person, so I am writing the notes to myself to not forget how to use this repository.

1. (in advance) Prepare examples in any folder.
1. Clear main.ts.
1. Run `yarn watch`.
1. Use an additional window to have examples aside.
1. Write down the examples or copy paste the parts that you want to explain.
